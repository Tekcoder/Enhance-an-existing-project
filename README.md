# How to use the app

* Go to the site link using the latest versions of modern browsers like Google Chrome or Mozilla Firefox. 

* On arrival, within the app, there's a field that has a placeholder that states "What needs to be done". Type the title of a task into it and then press Enter to include it to the list of tasks.

* Once the task has been added to the list, you may mark it as "completed" by clicking the checkbox to the left of the title. It is also possible to edit the task by double-clicking it.

* Below the list of tasks a filter section is located. This allows you to filter the displayed tasks by completed, active, or all tasks. In this area, a button to clear all completed tasks is also located.
